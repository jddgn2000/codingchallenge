Technology 
The technology that I used was CodeIgniter: CodeIgniter is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed for a given task. Also, it is based with MVC (View, Model and Controller).

API / User Interface
This is an User Interface (web/browser) that can display content from data source.  This API communicate with the selected data source (in this example is New York Times Books (apiKey), but you can implement other different data sources which Reddit(OAuth), Github(OAuth), Giphy(apiKey), HackerNews.  But, this is an example of the implementation that you can follow for different data sources.
This exercise is very useful because you can learn and practice different important concepts for instance:
    •	Login (user/password)
    •	Implementation of MVC(View, Model and Controller)
    •	Learn de framework CodeIgniter base on PHP and MVC
    •	Implement maintenance for databases DML(Data Manipulation Language: SELECT / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE (CRUD)
    o	CRUD for Data Sources:  use CRUD for maintenance for data sources.
    o	CRUD for methods or implementations for the New York Times:  use CRUD for maintenance for the implementations.
    •	DDL for creation of database 
    •	javascript
    •	ajax for add and edit registers 
    •	boostrap
    •	jquery
    •	CSS
